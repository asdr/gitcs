Git Client Server :)
Anayone who wants to use git client on server, and collect all repositories of user to one (logically) centre
may use this.

Not very exiting and i dont know exacyly who wants to use, however, in a way this can help people manage
multiple git repositories.

As cons of this project:
  -- first of all, totaly conflifts with the philosophy of git.
  -- every git operation is now on the line. this means the speed of git may (will) decrease.
  -- every file transfer is now on the line. you know what this means ...

But, as i say management of all repositories of users will be handled in one place. Cloud development 
environments is be able to use gitcs easily. (Cloudful project?)
